# Cybersecurity Project

This project demonstrates various cybersecurity techniques using Python.

## Modules
1. *AES Encryption & Decryption* - Uses AES encryption for securing messages.
2. *Password Hashing* - Demonstrates hashing of passwords with SHA256.
3. *Port Scanner* - Scans for open ports on a target machine.
4. *Firewall Simulation* - A simple simulation of a firewall that filters traffic based on IP and Port.

## Requirements
- Install pycryptodome library for AES encryption:
  
  pip install pycryptodome
  
- For other modules, the standard Python libraries are sufficient.

## How to Run
You can run individual Python files by executing them in your terminal:

python aes_encryption.py python password_hashing.py python port_scanner.py python firewall_simulation.py
